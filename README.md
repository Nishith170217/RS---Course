# Recommender System ---Course
The scope of artificial intelligence is too large. Recommendation system is a new branch of artificial intelligence, involving many contents. I hope we can start from the simplest point of view so that we can understand it.

Infact Recommender systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders.

We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.It's not easy for you to come to China, especially during the epidemic period. I hope every student can learn some cutting-edge content of AI, from theory to practice (code). If you are interested in the content, you can learn more deeply.
